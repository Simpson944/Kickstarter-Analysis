# Kickstarting with Excel

## What is this report? 
### Utilizing a kickstarter dataset, we will evaluate the funding outcomes of campaigns based on their start date and their goals.   

## What is our purpose?
### We will utilize the findings to understand how we can target future campaigns to achieve the best outcomes. 

## What is the data evaluating? 
### Our analysis centers around “like” campaigns in the theater sphere. Some of our challenges within the dataset include erroneous goals that far exceed realistic expectations, and outside influences that are not captured within the data (such as climate events, health of the economy, etc.)   

### Our data indicates a higher success rate with campaings that launch in May. Additionally, October and December have the highest rate of failed outcomes in relation to the total amount of campaings at 43% and 46% respectively. 

### Our data indicates that campains with a funding goal of 1,000 to 4,999 have the highest success rate. This goal set has a success rate of 75%; furthermore, this goal range houses over 50% of all projects.  

## What were the challenges with the evaluation of the data? 
### One difficulty involved weighing the success rate against the amaount of projects in that goal range. For instance, our highest success rate only consists of 18% of total projects.   

## Results: We will have the highest chance of success by launching our campaign in May. We have the lowest chance of success when launching our campaign in October. When evaluating a goal for the campaign, We will have the most success when setting our goals within the 1,000 to 4,999 range. We are limited in our understanding of demographics and incomes, which may be helpful evaluating a goal and targeted audience. We could create additional charts using the staff pick section vs success rate to understand the reactions to the project before releasing to the public. We could utilize the average donation for our campaign type to understand what to expect from succsessful launches.
